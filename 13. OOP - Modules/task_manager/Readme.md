Practical Task

In this practical task, you are going to implement and test the task manager
application you designed in the Software Design Task.

Follow the steps below to complete the task. You do not have to provide written
answers to the questions, as they are meant to guide your thinking.

    1) Set up a virtual environment for your project while considering the
    following points:
        ● What steps will you take to create a virtual environment for your
        project?
        ● Which tool or package will you use to manage the virtual
        environment?

    2) PEP 8 Linting: Set up a PEP 8 linter for your project, considering the below
    points:
        ● How will you integrate PEP 8 linting into your project?
        ● Are there specific PEP 8 rules or configurations you want to enforce
        or ignore?

    3) PEP 8 Compliance:
        ● Ensure that your code adheres to PEP 8 standards.
        ● Make any necessary adjustments to achieve compliance.

    4) Implement your task manager application following your design:
        ● Develop the necessary classes based on your design. Feel free to
        redesign the application to suit your implementation needs if you
        have discovered design improvements during your implementation
        phase.
        ● Implement a file-based data access layer to support your application.
        ● Remember to split your code into multiple modules. A common
        practice is to have one class or set of related functions or constants
        per Python module.

    5) Write unit tests:
        ● Identify at least five use cases based on your design task.
        ● Write unit tests that test your implementation against these use
        cases. We suggest simplifying the tests you choose by testing the
        model, because testing the code with dependencies on a file and
        terminal will require that the file or terminal be available at the time
        that you run your tests. You cannot guarantee their availability, and
        this would complicate your workflow. If you are interested in how
        such tests are performed, you can read about mock testing and
        integration testing in your spare time.

    6) Use a tool like pip freeze to generate a requirements.txt file
