What is normalisation?:

• Normalisation is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations.
	Redundancy in relation may cause insertion, deletion, and update anomalies.
	So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in relations.
	Normal forms are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables. 


When is a table in 1NF?:

• The data must be presented in a tabular format, where each cell has a single
	value and there are no repeating groups meaning all columns contain only
	atomic values—that is, each column can have only one value for each row in the table.


When is a table in 2NF?:

• A table is in Second Normal Form (2NF) if it is in 1NF and has no partial key dependencies
	once the primary key has been identified. In other words, every non-primary-key
	attribute is fully functionally dependent on the primary key, then the relation
	is in Second Normal Form (2NF).


When is a table in 3NF?:

• A table is said to be in 3NF when it is in 2NF; and it contains no transitive dependencies which are
	are dependencies of one non-prime attribute (an attribute that is not part of a primary key)
	on another non-prime attribute.


What is a foreign key?:

•  foreign keys are columns that link to primary key columns in other tables, thereby creating a relationship
